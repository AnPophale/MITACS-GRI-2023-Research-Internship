# MITACS GRI Summer Research Internship 
### Fuzzy clustering based Partial Least Squares (PLS) modelling for microgel property prediction

I was one of the top 1000 students from India selected for the MITACS Globalink Research Internship 2023 to pursue a fully funded summer research internship at McMaster University, Canada. I worked on data driven modelling for microgel property prediction under Prof. Prashant Mhaskar in the Department of Chemical Engieering at McMaster University

The final project presentation is available [here]. A breif explanation of the project is given below:
